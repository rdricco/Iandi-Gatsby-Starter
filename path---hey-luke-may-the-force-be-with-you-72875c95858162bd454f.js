Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed. Escape is not his plan. I must face him, alone. I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to Alderaan--\n\nDon't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. __You weren't on any mercy mission this time.__ *Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies.* I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.\n\n## Don't underestimate the Force.\n\nYe-ha! But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it? Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.\n\n1. Still, she's got a lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think?\n2. I find your lack of faith disturbing.\n3. I'm surprised you had the courage to take the responsibility yourself.\n\n### As you wish.\n\nHey, Luke! May the Force be with you. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers. Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.\n\n* You are a part of the Rebel Alliance and a traitor! Take her away!\n* Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.\n* What?!\n\nHey, Luke! May the Force be with you. What!? Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I call it luck. Don't underestimate the Force. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands.\n\nAlderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I have traced the Rebel spies to her. Now she is my only link to finding their secret base.\n\nAlderaan? I'm not going to Alderaan. I've got to go home. It's late, I'm in for it as it is. I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your conscious self and act on instinct. The Force is strong with this one. I have you now.\n\nObi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Hokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it?\n\nOh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? He is here. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? I can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now. It's such a long way from here.\n\nHokey religions and ancient weapons are no match for a good blaster at your side, kid. A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. I'm trying not to, kid. The more you tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more star systems will slip through your fingers.\n\nI find your lack of faith disturbing. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time!\n\nYou mean it controls your actions? What!? Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.\n\nYou're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?\n\nLook, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. Don't act so surprised, Your Highness. You weren't on any mercy mission this time. Several transmissions were beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.\n\nI can't get involved! I've got work to do! It's not that I like the Empire, I hate it, but there's nothing I can do about it right now.
