She's a witch! …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate? Shut up! Will you shut up?! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. How do you know she is a witch?\n\nI dunno. Must be a king. __Why do you think that she is a witch?__ *Burn her!* The swallow may fly south with the sun, and the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land.\n\n## What do you mean?\n\nYou can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. Well, we did do the nose. Shut up! Will you shut up?!\n\n1. You don't vote for kings.\n2. Why do you think that she is a witch?\n3. Why?\n\n### I'm not a witch.\n\nYou don't frighten us, English pig-dogs! Go and boil your bottoms, sons of a silly person! I blow my nose at you, so-called Ah-thoor Keeng, you and all your silly English K-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-niggits! Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot!\n\n* I dunno. Must be a king.\n* Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods.\n* Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni!\n\nOn second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. Well, she turned me into a newt. Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! Who's that then? The nose? And the hat. She's a witch!\n\nShe looks like one. Well, I got better. Shut up! Will you shut up?! Who's that then? Shut up! Now, look here, my good man.\n\nShut up! Will you shut up?! But you are dressed as one… Ni! Ni! Ni! Ni! You don't vote for kings. Bloody Peasant!\n\nHow do you know she is a witch? It's only a model. A newt? Look, my liege! Oh, ow! We found them.\n\nOn second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place. I am your king. And the hat. She's a witch! Knights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. On second thoughts, let's not go there. It is a silly place.\n\nBut you are dressed as one… No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! I'm not a witch. Be quiet! Where'd you get the coconuts?\n\nKnights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. Bring her forward! No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. And the hat. She's a witch! You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!\n\nNow, look here, my good man. I have to push the pram a lot. Oh, ow! …Are you suggesting that coconuts migrate?\n\nKnights of Ni, we are but simple travelers who seek the enchanter who lives beyond these woods. I'm not a witch. Where'd you get the coconuts? Well, we did do the nose.\n\nAnd the hat. She's a witch! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us. Well, how'd you become king, then? The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite, held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am your king.\n\nOh, ow! I don't want to talk to you no more, you empty-headed animal food trough water! I fart in your general direction! Your mother was a hamster and your father smelt of elderberries!
